    MPDSS was set up in 2020, with the aim of improving the oral health of children in the Manchester area. Over the years, the society has evolved to provide a range of events for dental students, as well as setting up the first ever podcast dedicated to paediatric dentistry!

    MPDSS has worked hard to provide oral health education sessions to key stage 1 pupils. Specifically, we target our sessions towards schools with high intakes of children from disadvantaged backgrounds. According the GMCA "more than 1 in 3 five year-olds across Greater Manchester experience tooth decay- well above the England national average of 25%". It is the main aim of the MPDSS to help tackle childhood dental decay and reduce the need for preventable surgeries and extractions.

    We look forwards to providing our primary school sessions in the 21/22 academic year. Our projects are supported by the University of Manchester Student Union and 'Access All Areas' project.

        this academic year!  \n  \nI was very pleased with what the society managed
        to achieve last year, however COVID did impede some of our plans (notably,
        our primary school sessions). I feel optimistic that our sessions will be
        going ahead in the new academic year, and we have been working hard behind
        the scenes to make that happen!  \n  \nAlong with the primary school sessions,
        I will be continuing the BITEsize Paediatrics podcast with my co-host, Chloe.
        I also hope that we will be able to put on fun and engaging events throughout
        the year, so keep your eyes peeled!  \n  \nIt’s going to be a great year and
        I hope that you will benefit from our society in some way!"
