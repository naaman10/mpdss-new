    Our committee have worked tirelessly over the Summer to coordinate primary school sessions and events which are carefully designed with our target audience in mind. We have also collaborated with specialists within the relevant dental fields to create these events.

    Various members of our committee contact schools and speakers directly in order to arrange educational sessions with them, however, we also welcome approach from schools and speakers that/who are interested in getting involved with our society.

        Firstly, I would like to give a warm welcome to any visitors to this website!

        My name is Yasmin and I am in my second year of dental schools at the University of Manchester. I set up MPDSS after identifying that I had (and still have) a vested interest in paediatric dentistry; but there were not many opportunities for me to learn about this speciality until later years.

        I am committed to preventative dentistry and improving the oral health of students in the Manchester area. In particular, I have wanted to focus on educating primary school students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. I also have the aim of being able to open up the world of paediatric dentistry to any dental student at my University who is interested in learning more.

        I am thoroughly excited to see where we can take this society and I look forward to leading the committee.

    Venenatis taciti feugiat magnis maecenas euismod hac nibh leo. Nulla fames dolor mi tempor curae quis congue maximus odio. Fringilla dignissim himenaeos nec posuere. Maximus mattis arcu quis aliquam ac.

    Another paragraph just to make it even longer. How much more can I add to the paragraph before I run out of ideas? Is it one sentence more, or even two, I don't know if I have anymore.
