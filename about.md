    MPDSS was set up in 2020, with the aim of improving the oral health of children in the Manchester area. Over the years, the society has evolved to provide a range of events for dental students, as well as setting up the first ever podcast dedicated to paediatric dentistry!

    MPDSS has worked hard to provide oral health education sessions to key stage 1 pupils. Specifically, we target our sessions towards schools with high intakes of children from disadvantaged backgrounds. According the GMCA "more than 1 in 3 five year-olds across Greater Manchester experience tooth decay- well above the England national average of 25%". It is the main aim of the MPDSS to help tackle childhood dental decay and reduce the need for preventable surgeries and extractions.

    We look forwards to providing our primary school sessions in the 21/22 academic year. Our projects are supported by the University of Manchester Student Union and 'Access All Areas' project.

    Another paragraph just to make it even longer. How much more can I add to the paragraph before I run out of ideas? Is it one sentence more, or even two, I don't know if I have anymore.
