A gravel bike, an adventure bike, a bike designed by hardy northern obsessives for genuine four season fun. A bike that says “yes please” regardless of what the sky is doing or where the terrain is going.

We have been inundated with requests for a stoic metal bike that will “take a battering” without being so over engineered that even the idea of riding it up a hill makes you break out into a sweat.

The Adventurer is sprightly enough to race cyclocross, if you really wanted. But we think most of you will forget the races and head off the beaten track.

We’ve worked tirelessly to design a frame that can be many things to many riders. In its final form, The Adventurer is the kind of bike that sends you a DM whilst you’re at work on a dreary Thursday morning and asks you if you’ve got plans for the next bank holiday weekend. _“We could just throw the bags on and go bikepacking, couldn’t we!”_ it says - _“we could even take the tent, and the dog, and we could stop at that lovely pub you always pass when you’re dressed in lycra!”_.*
