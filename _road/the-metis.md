An astonishingly quick frame, designed and hand made in the UK by experienced carbon fibre experts. The frame is painstakingly built with Toray T800 and T1100 carbon fibre. The NorthRoad Metis a serious choice for anyone looking for a super-aerodynamic road bike.

Lighter than previous aero models and with a fully integrated design, that has no cables or hoses on display, the Metis is our premium road bike. This high modulus carbon frame is built for speed.

Shimano or SRAM electronic hydraulic groupsets, or indeed mechanical groupsets, mean you won't miss a shift.

NorthRoad 50mm deep, carbon wheels come as standard on this super bike, as do Pirelli P-Zero tyres.

This is a ready to race bike and as with all NorthRoad bicycles we will build it totally to your specification - every element can be chosen and built just for you. So, if you want different wheels, saddle, a Campagnolo groupset or specific club colours on your frame NorthRoad can create the bike for you.
