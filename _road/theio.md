A lightweight aero frame, carbon wheels and disc brakes. This is a great choice for the rider looking for speed and great handling and, of course, amazing looks.

If you’re seeking a speed advantage on the group ride or an edge in an important race the IO is an ideal choice.

The integrated design (no external cables) maximises aerodynamic efficiency and looks sleek and superb.
