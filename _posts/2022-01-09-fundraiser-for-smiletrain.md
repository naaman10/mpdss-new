Did you benefit from our anatomy revision sessions? If so, please consider paying the deed forward to our fundraiser.

Smile train is a charity that provides free surgery and support for children with cleft lip/palate. They have helped 1.5 million children so far.

Did you know 1/700 children have a cleft lip or palate?

Along with @mudrsoc, we would like to raise over £100 for charity. Even £1 would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you
