podcast_description: "This month's episode is a short but sweet summary of the ways
  in which dentists can adapt care for children with Autism! We are joined by Professor
  Siobhan Barry - a Consultant in Paediatric Dentistry at the University of Manchester
  Dental Hospital.\n\nWithin this episode be cover the following:  \n  \n\\- What
  is Autism?  \n\\- What is 'stimming' and how should a clinician react to these sounds/actions?
  \ \n\\- What challenges can children with Autism face, when attending the dentist?
  \ \n\\- Are general practitioners capable of treating these children?  \n\\- What
  are some common mistakes made by general practitioners?  \n\\- Are these children
  more at risk for oral diseases?  \n\\- How might children with Autism communicate?\n\nWe
  hope that this resource can be used by students and clinicians alike to look at
  the ways that they can adapt dental care for these patients!\n\nExtra resources
