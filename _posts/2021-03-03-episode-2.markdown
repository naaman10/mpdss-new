podcast_description: "Getting a phobic child into the dental chair can be an extremely
  difficult task, let alone injecting them with local anaesthetic!  \n  \nThis episode
  features the brilliant Dr. Greig Taylor; a Paediatric Specialist at the University
  of Newcastle. We discuss his paper 'A Clinical Guide to Needle Desensitization for
  the Paediatric Patient' which acts as a simple and comprehensive guide to a daunting
  task that all dental professionals will face.  \n  \nIn this episode we cover topics
  such as:  \n  \n\\- The causes of dental phobia in children.  \n\\- How to tell
  if a patient is an information seeker or an information avoider.  \n\\- Relaxation
  techniques for children to practice at home and in the clinic.  \n\\- The 7-step
  needle desensitization technique.  \n\\- Distraction techniques.  \n\\- Modified
  Child Dental Anxiety Scale.  \n  \nExtra resources to accompany this episode can
