podcast_description: "When it comes to discussing dentistry in the UK vs. USA, it
  seems that us British have a pretty bad rep! But behind the glitz and glam of American
  dentistry, is the oral health of children in the US any better than the kids on
  the other side of the pond?  \n  \nThis episode features [Dr Nidhi Kotak](https://www.instagram.com/dr.nidhikotak/);
  a Paediatric Dental Resident hailing all the way from Philadelphia. Today we discuss
  the differences between paediatric dentistry and child oral health in the UK. vs.
  USA.  \n  \nIn this episode we compare the following:  \n  \n\\- Dental specialities
  offered.  \n\\- The cost of paediatric dental care for the parent.  \n\\- Paediatric
  dental decay statistics.  \n\\- The average age that a child first visits the dentist.
  \ \n\\- Water fluoridation and attitudes towards it.  \n\\- Governmental control
  of sugar content in food and drink.  \n\\- The impact of COVID on paediatric dentistry.
