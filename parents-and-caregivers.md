    DO I HAVE TO PAY FOR MY
    CHILD'S DENTAL VISIT?
    NHS practices do not charge for
    children's dental care.
    HOW DO I FIND AN NHS DENTIST?
    You can call NHS England's Customer
    Contact Centre on:
    0300 311 2233
    In the case of a dental emergency, please
    call NHS 111
    WHAT SHOULD I DO IF MY CHILD IS
    ANXIOUS ABOUT A VISIT?
    (1) Avoid scary language, such as "pain",
    "needle", "drill". Try and use child-friendly
    explanations or words, e.g.
    "The dentist will put your tooth to sleep so that
    she can remove the sugar bugs!"
    (2) Keep a positive attitude towards the visit
    and try not to let any of your own anxieties
    show.
    (3) Do a pretend visit! You can use the end
    of their toothbrush to count each of their
    teeth as they open wide - just like the dentist
    would! This will get your child more familiar
    with the routine.
    (4) Use media e.g. Youtube videos or books that
    cover the topic of visiting the dentist to further
    familiarise them with the concept.

    fluid other than milk or cool boiled water\nshould be given in a bottle.\nChildren

    caries\" describes tooth decay in children,\nlinked to continuous dripping of
    sugary liquids\nonto the teeth.\nIt often happens when a child is allowed to\nsleep
    with their bottles containing milk, juice, or\nother sugar-containing drinks.\n\nWHAT
    DOES IT LOOK LIKE?\nIt usually develops around the upper front teeth, as\nthis
    is where the sugary liquid pools when a child is\ndrinking and letting the liquid
    sit in their mouth.\nThe decay can first appear as a slight change on the teeth\n(A).
    It can make the teeth look more yellow or brown.\nThe decay can quickly develop
    and appear black in\ncolour \n(B). The child will likely have sensitivity and
    pain.\n\nHOW TO AVOID BOTTLE CARIES:\nNo fluid other than milk or cool boiled
    water\nshould be given in a bottle.\nChildren should not be left with a bottle
    to suckle\nwhilst asleep.\nExtra sugars (e.g. table sugar) should not be added\nto
