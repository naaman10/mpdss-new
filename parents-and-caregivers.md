    DO I HAVE TO PAY FOR MY
    CHILD'S DENTAL VISIT?

    NHS practices do not charge for
    children's dental care.

    HOW DO I FIND AN NHS DENTIST?

    You can call NHS England's Customer

    Contact Centre on: 0300 311 2233

    In the case of a dental emergency, please call NHS 111
    WHAT SHOULD I DO IF MY CHILD IS ANXIOUS ABOUT A VISIT?

    (1) Avoid scary language, such as "pain", "needle", "drill". Try and use child-friendly
    explanations or words, e.g. "The dentist will put your tooth to sleep so that she can remove the sugar bugs!"

    (2) Keep a positive attitude towards the visit and try not to let any of your own anxieties
    show.

    (3) Do a pretend visit! You can use the end of their toothbrush to count each of their teeth as they open wide - just like the dentist would! This will get your child more familiar with the routine.

    (4) Use media e.g. Youtube videos or books that cover the topic of visiting the dentist to further familiarise them with the concept.

  section_text: "\nBOTTLE FEEDING AND CARIES\n\nNo fluid other than milk or cool boiled
    water\nshould be given in a bottle.\n\nChildren should not be left with a bottle
    to suckle\nwhilst asleep.\n\nExtra sugars (e.g. table sugar) should not be added\nto
    bottles of formula feed or boiled water.\n\nBottle-feeding should be discouraged\nfrom
    one years old.\n\n\nWHAT ARE 'BOTTLE CARIES'?\n\n\"Bottle caries\" describes tooth
    decay in children,\nlinked to continuous dripping of sugary liquids\nonto the
    teeth.\nIt often happens when a child is allowed to\nsleep with their bottles
    containing milk, juice, or\nother sugar-containing drinks.\n\nWHAT DOES IT LOOK
    LIKE?\n\nIt usually develops around the upper front teeth, as\nthis is where the
    sugary liquid pools when a child is\ndrinking and letting the liquid sit in their
    mouth.\nThe decay can first appear as a slight change on the teeth\n(A). It can
    make the teeth look more yellow or brown.\nThe decay can quickly develop and appear
    black in\ncolour \n\n(B). The child will likely have sensitivity and pain.\n\n"
