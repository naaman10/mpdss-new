  title: Want to volunteer with us?
  section_text: "In order to volunteer with us, you must be a student on the BDS Dentistry
    or BSc Oral Health Sciences course at the University of Manchester. You must possess
    an advanced DBS check (of which we verify with the University).\n\nThere is high
    demand to volunteer for our sessions, and so we cannot guarantee that all applicants
    can be provided with a slot. However, please do feel free to email us via [mpdss.uom@gmail.com](mailto:mpdss.uom@gmail.com)
    and enquire about availability.  \n   \n We also suggest that you follow us @MPDSSOC
    on Instagram, Twitter and/or Facebook to get volunteering updates. "
