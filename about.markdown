    Our committee have worked tirelessly over the Summer to coordinate primary school sessions and events which are carefully designed with our target audience in mind. We have also collaborated with specialists within the relevant dental fields to create these events.

    Various members of our committee contact schools and speakers directly in order to arrange educational sessions with them, however, we also welcome approach from schools and speakers that/who are interested in getting involved with our society.
