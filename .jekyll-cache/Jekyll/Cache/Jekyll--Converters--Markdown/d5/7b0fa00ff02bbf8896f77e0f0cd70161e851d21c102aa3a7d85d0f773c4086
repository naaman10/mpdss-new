I"ÿ<p>Volunteers are vital for the running of our primary school sessions. Currently, we are only accepting Manchester University dental and oral health science students into the volunteering workforce as we require all of our volunteers to have had an advanced DBS check.</p>

<p>As we are a new society, we aim to start our oral health education sessions in a limited number of schools. Once we have established which aspects of our sessions work well/could be improved; we will then expand our sessions to more primary schools in the Manchester area.</p>

<p>Therefore, there will be a limited number of volunteer vacancies in our first year of operation. We will advertise all volunteering vacancies on this website and on social media - please keep an eye out!</p>
