I"<p>An astonishingly quick frame, designed and hand made in the UK by experienced carbon fibre experts. The frame is painstakingly built with Toray T800 and T1100 carbon fibre. The NorthRoad Metis a serious choice for anyone looking for a super-aerodynamic road bike.</p>

<p>Lighter than previous aero models and with a fully integrated design, that has no cables or hoses on display, the Metis is our premium road bike. This high modulus carbon frame is built for speed.</p>

<p>Shimano or SRAM electronic hydraulic groupsets, or indeed mechanical groupsets, mean you wonâ€™t miss a shift.</p>

<p>NorthRoad 50mm deep, carbon wheels come as standard on this super bike, as do Pirelli P-Zero tyres.</p>

<p>This is a ready to race bike and as with all NorthRoad bicycles we will build it totally to your specification - every element can be chosen and built just for you. So, if you want different wheels, saddle, a Campagnolo groupset or specific club colours on your frame NorthRoad can create the bike for you.</p>
