I"L<p>Molar Incisor Hypomineralisation is more than just a mouthful to say - it is a dental condition that affects around 1 in 5 people in the UK! This condition can significantly affect a childâ€™s quality of life, however, not many members of the public (and dentists) know about it.</p>

<p>We were lucky enough to interview Dr Judi Humphreys, a Paediatric Specialist based at the University of Liverpool, about this condition. She has dedicated her postdoctorate research to the management of MIH, and is looking to improve clinical guidelines. This episode acts as a nice summary of all that is MIH, including diagnosis, treatment, and causes.</p>
