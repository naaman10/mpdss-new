<p>WHAT ARE ‘BOTTLE CARIES’?</p>

<p>“Bottle caries” describes tooth decay in children,
linked to continuous dripping of sugary liquids
onto the teeth.
It often happens when a child is allowed to
sleep with their bottles containing milk, juice, or
other sugar-containing drinks.</p>

<p>WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?</p>

<p>It usually develops around the upper front teeth, as
this is where the sugary liquid pools when a child is
drinking and letting the liquid sit in their mouth.
The decay can first appear as a slight change on the teeth
(A). It can make the teeth look more yellow or brown.
The decay can quickly develop and appear black in
colour</p>

<p>(B). The child will likely have sensitivity and pain.</p>
