            <p class="card-text"><p>One of the core aims of our society is to deliver oral health education sessions to primary schools in the Manchester area. “Oral health education” entails the exploration of many topics. In our primary school sessions we aim to cover: what a healthy diet is, how to take care of your mouth, and what to expect when visiting the dentist.</p>
