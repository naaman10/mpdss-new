I"Ï<p>Hello! My name is Summa Bains and I am a second year dental student at the University of Manchester.</p>

<p>As treasurer for MPDSS, I am responsible for overseeing the financial affairs of the society, exercising fiduciary duties along with my fellow founding members to ensure the sustainability of MPDSS.</p>

<p>I am very excited and honoured to work with the committee in establishing the foundations of this new society, and equally keen to raise oral health standards amongst children through our campaigning and outreach work with local primary schools.</p>

<p>I am committed to ensuring all our hosted events are of great value to both fellow dental students as well as the wider Manchester community.</p>
