I"u<p>Firstly, I would like to give a warm welcome to any visitors to this website!</p>

<p>My name is Yasmin and I am in my second year of dental schools at the University of Manchester. I set up MPDSS after identifying that I had (and still have) a vested interest in paediatric dentistry; but there were not many opportunities for me to learn about this speciality until later years.</p>

<p>I am committed to preventative dentistry and improving the oral health of students in the Manchester area. In particular, I have wanted to focus on educating primary school students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. I also have the aim of being able to open up the world of paediatric dentistry to any dental student at my University who is interested in learning more.</p>

<p>I am thoroughly excited to see where we can take this society and I look forward to leading the committee.</p>
