I"‡<p>(1) Oral hygiene practice:</p>

<p>We use mouth models and dental appliances to teach the children how to brush and floss correctly. Each child will have their own appliances to practice with, and we will have an open discussion about the key features of a good routine. We include songs and sticker rewards at this station.</p>

<p>(2) Play-doh tooth modelling:</p>

<p>We will use play-doh to model teeth, of which the children can place into a mouth model (until they model a whole set of different teeth). We will use dark coloured play-doh to mimic the main places where decay can develop on the teeth! We will have an open discussion about what causes the decay, and what we can do to easily prevent it.</p>

<p>(3) Visit to the dentist - roleplay:</p>

<p>We have collected a range of barbie and ken dentist dolls, equipped with dentist surgery set ups and child patients! The dentist dolls have been selected to represent different genders, races, and disabilities, which mimics the diversity of dentists in the real world.</p>

<p>Each child will choose their dentist doll, and patient doll. We will then act out the different steps involved in a dentist visit. We will have a look at different tools that a dentist might use and we will use approachable language in order to dispel the idea that visiting the dentist is a scary experience.</p>

<p>(4) Sugar station:</p>

<p>In this station, we lay out a range of plastic toy food and drink items on the table. Each child will be tasked with a range of different games designed to look at the sugar content of certain items. We will also look at how sugar can negatively affect the teeth, as well as other body parts.</p>

<p>This interactive station will get the children to measure of sugar content on a food weighing scale, and we will compare this to the recommended intake for a child of their age.</p>

<p>(5) Storytime and colouring:</p>

<p>This station is a chilled-out time for the kids to colour in our MPDSS-designed colouring sheets whilst also listening to a story based on the theme of dentistry and good oral health. It will provide the opportunity of volunteers to ask what the children have learnt</p>
