I"Z<p>A gravel bike, an adventure bike, a bike designed by hardy northern obsessives for genuine four season fun. A bike that says “yes please” regardless of what the sky is doing or where the terrain is going.</p>

<p>We have been inundated with requests for a stoic metal bike that will “take a battering” without being so over engineered that even the idea of riding it up a hill makes you break out into a sweat.</p>

<p>The Adventurer is sprightly enough to race cyclocross, if you really wanted. But we think most of you will forget the races and head off the beaten track.</p>

<p>We’ve worked tirelessly to design a frame that can be many things to many riders. In its final form, The Adventurer is the kind of bike that sends you a DM whilst you’re at work on a dreary Thursday morning and asks you if you’ve got plans for the next bank holiday weekend. <em>“We could just throw the bags on and go bikepacking, couldn’t we!”</em> it says - <em>“we could even take the tent, and the dog, and we could stop at that lovely pub you always pass when you’re dressed in lycra!”</em>.*</p>
