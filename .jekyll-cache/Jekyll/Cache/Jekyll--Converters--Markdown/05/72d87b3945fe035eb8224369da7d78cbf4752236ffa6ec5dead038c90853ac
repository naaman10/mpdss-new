I"h<p>MPDSS was set up in 2020, with the aim of improving the oral health of children in the Manchester area. Over the years, the society has evolved to provide a range of events for dental students, as well as setting up the first ever podcast dedicated to paediatric dentistry!</p>

<p>MPDSS has worked hard to provide oral health education sessions to key stage 1 pupils. Specifically, we target our sessions towards schools with high intakes of children from disadvantaged backgrounds. According the GMCA “more than 1 in 3 five year-olds across Greater Manchester experience tooth decay- well above the England national average of 25%”. It is the main aim of the MPDSS to help tackle childhood dental decay and reduce the need for preventable surgeries and extractions.</p>

<p>We look forwards to providing our primary school sessions in the 21/22 academic year. Our projects are supported by the University of Manchester Student Union and ‘Access All Areas’ project.</p>
