I"d<p>Charting mixed dentition can be a daunting task for dental and oral health science students - and even some qualified dentists! The variability in mixed dentition can make the task of charting, in a limited amount of time, confusing. We would like to improve the confidence of dental students so that they feel comfortable treating paediatric patients.</p>

Our course is being created by the President (Yasmin) and Vice President (Sabina), along with the expertise and assistance of Dr. Siobhan Barry - an experienced paediatric consultant at the University Dental Hospital of Manchester.</p>

<p>We aim to make this course applicable to all year groups.</p>
