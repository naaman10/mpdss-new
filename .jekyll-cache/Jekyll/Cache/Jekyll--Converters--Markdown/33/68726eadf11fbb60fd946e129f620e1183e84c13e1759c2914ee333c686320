I"o<p>In order to volunteer with us, you must be a student on the BDS Dentistry or BSc Oral Health Sciences course at the University of Manchester. You must possess an advanced DBS check (of which we verify with the University).</p>

<p>There is high demand to volunteer for our sessions, and so we cannot guarantee that all applicants can be provided with a slot. However, please do feel free to email us via <a href="mailto:mpdss.uom@gmail.com">mpdss.uom@gmail.com</a> and enquire about availability.</p>

<p>We also suggest that you follow us @MPDSSOC on Instagram, Twitter and/or Facebook to get volunteering updates.</p>
