WHAT SHOULD I DO IF MY CHILD IS ANXIOUS ABOUT A VISIT?</p>

<p>(1) Avoid scary language, such as “pain”, “needle”, “drill”. Try and use child-friendly
explanations or words, e.g. “The dentist will put your tooth to sleep so that she can remove the sugar bugs!”</p>

<p>(2) Keep a positive attitude towards the visit and try not to let any of your own anxieties
show.</p>

<p>(3) Do a pretend visit! You can use the end of their toothbrush to count each of their teeth as they open wide - just like the dentist would! This will get your child more familiar with the routine.</p>

<p>(4) Use media e.g. Youtube videos or books that cover the topic of visiting the dentist to further familiarise them with the concept.</p>
