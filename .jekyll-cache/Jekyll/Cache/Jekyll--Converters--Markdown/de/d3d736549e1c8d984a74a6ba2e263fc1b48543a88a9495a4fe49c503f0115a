I"Q<p>This month’s episode is a short but sweet summary of the ways in which dentists can adapt care for children with Autism! We are joined by Professor Siobhan Barry - a Consultant in Paediatric Dentistry at the University of Manchester Dental Hospital.</p>

<p>Within this episode be cover the following:</p>

<p>- What is Autism?<br />
- What is ‘stimming’ and how should a clinician react to these sounds/actions?<br />
- What challenges can children with Autism face, when attending the dentist?<br />
- Are general practitioners capable of treating these children?<br />
- What are some common mistakes made by general practitioners?<br />
- Are these children more at risk for oral diseases?<br />
- How might children with Autism communicate?</p>

<p>We hope that this resource can be used by students and clinicians alike to look at the ways that they can adapt dental care for these patients!</p>
