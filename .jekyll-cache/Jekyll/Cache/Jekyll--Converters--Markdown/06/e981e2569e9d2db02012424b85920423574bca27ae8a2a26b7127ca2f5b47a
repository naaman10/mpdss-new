I"S<p>Hi everyone! My name is Hadiya and I’m the secretary for the MPDSS. As the secretary, my role will be to take minutes at meetings and ensure that all ideas and plans are noted down. I’m really looking forward to being a part of the MPDSS and I can’t wait to work with the children and also the other members of the committee!</p>
