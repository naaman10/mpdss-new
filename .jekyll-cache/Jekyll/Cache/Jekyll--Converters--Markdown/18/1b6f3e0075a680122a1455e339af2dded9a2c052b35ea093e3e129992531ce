I"<p>We are very excited to organise a host of talks for dental and oral health science students; delivered by respected paediatric dentists! This is a great way for students to learn more about the specilaity; which can introduce them to the speciality earlier on in their course or aid their pre-exisitng understanding of the speciality.</p>

<p>We welcome any speaker/topic suggestions from current students! Suggestions can be sent to mpdss@gmail.com to be picked up by our Speakers Co-ordinator (Saif).</p>

<p>We are making plans for these talks to be delivered in person, however, if this is not possible (due to the COVID-19 situation) then we will aim to deliver the talks online. Either way, we will ensure that the talks are both engaging and informative.</p>
