  section_text: 'We provide oral health education sessions to key stage 1 pupils in
    the Manchester area. We make the conscious effort to target schools that support
    a high number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our sessions cover a
    range of topics such as : visiting the dentist, correct brushing technique, basic
    tooth structure, correct brushing technique, basic tooth anatomy, how decay develops
    and how diet affects oral health.'

  section_text: "Our sessions are run by dental students, of whom have all had advanced
    DBS checks verified before training and volunteering. We typically have 5 volunteers
    running the sessions, with 2-3 committee members overseeing the session alongside
    primary school staff. We typically run sessions on Wednesdays but may have availability
    on other days!  \n   \n We offer 5 stations of which the children can rotate around.
    In each station, the children will learn about a different topic under the umbrella
    of oral health. We have designed each station to be fun, interactive, and informative!
    Check out our info for each:"
