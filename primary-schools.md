  section_text: 'We provide oral health education sessions to key stage 1 pupils in
    the Manchester area. We make the conscious effort to target schools that support
    a high number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our sessions cover a
    range of topics such as : visiting the dentist, correct brushing technique, basic
    tooth structure, correct brushing technique, basic tooth anatomy, how decay develops
    and how diet affects oral health.'

  section_text: "Our sessions are run by dental students, of whom have all had advanced
    DBS checks verified before training and volunteering. We typically have 5 volunteers
    running the sessions, with 2-3 committee members overseeing the session alongside
    primary school staff. We typically run sessions on Wednesdays but may have availability
    on other days!  \n   \n We offer 5 stations of which the children can rotate around.
    In each station, the children will learn about a different topic under the umbrella
    of oral health. We have designed each station to be fun, interactive, and informative!
    Check out our info for each:"

    (2) Play-doh tooth modelling:

    We will use play-doh to model teeth, of which the children can place into a mouth model (until they model a whole set of different teeth). We will use dark coloured play-doh to mimic the main places where decay can develop on the teeth! We will have an open discussion about what causes the decay, and what we can do to easily prevent it.

    (3) Visit to the dentist - roleplay:

    We have collected a range of barbie and ken dentist dolls, equipped with dentist surgery set ups and child patients! The dentist dolls have been selected to represent different genders, races, and disabilities, which mimics the diversity of dentists in the real world.

    Each child will choose their dentist doll, and patient doll. We will then act out the different steps involved in a dentist visit. We will have a look at different tools that a dentist might use and we will use approachable language in order to dispel the idea that visiting the dentist is a scary experience.

    (4) Sugar station:

    In this station, we lay out a range of plastic toy food and drink items on the table. Each child will be tasked with a range of different games designed to look at the sugar content of certain items. We will also look at how sugar can negatively affect the teeth, as well as other body parts.

    This interactive station will get the children to measure of sugar content on a food weighing scale, and we will compare this to the recommended intake for a child of their age.

    (5) Storytime and colouring:

    This station is a chilled-out time for the kids to colour in our MPDSS-designed colouring sheets whilst also listening to a story based on the theme of dentistry and good oral health. It will provide the opportunity of volunteers to ask what the children have learnt.
