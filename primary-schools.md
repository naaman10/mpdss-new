  section_text: 'We provide oral health education sessions to key stage 1 pupils in
    the Manchester area. We make the conscious effort to target schools that support
    a high number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our sessions cover a
    range of topics such as : visiting the dentist, correct brushing technique, basic
    tooth structure, correct brushing technique, basic tooth anatomy, how decay develops
    and how diet affects oral health.'

  section_text: "Our sessions are run by dental students, of whom have all had advanced
    DBS checks verified before training and volunteering. We typically have 5 volunteers
    running the sessions, with 2-3 committee members overseeing the session alongside
    primary school staff. We typically run sessions on Wednesdays but may have availability
    on other days!  \n   \n We offer 5 stations of which the children can rotate around.
    In each station, the children will learn about a different topic under the umbrella
    of oral health. We have designed each station to be fun, interactive, and informative!
    Check out our info for each:"

  section_text: "(1) Oral hygiene practice:  \n   \n We use mouth models and dental
    appliances to teach the children how to brush and floss correctly. Each child
    will have their own appliances to practice with, and we will have an open discussion
    about the key features of a good routine. We include songs and sticker rewards
    at this station.  \n   \n (2) Play-doh tooth modelling:  \n   \n We will use play-doh
    to model teeth, of which the children can place into a mouth model (until they
    model a whole set of different teeth). We will use dark coloured play-doh to mimic
    the main places where decay can develop on the teeth! We will have an open discussion
    about what causes the decay, and what we can do to easily prevent it.  \n   \n
    (3) Visit to the dentist - roleplay:  \n   \n We have collected a range of barbie
    and ken dentist dolls, equipped with dentist surgery set ups and child patients!
    The dentist dolls have been selected to represent different genders, races, and
    disabilities, which mimics the diversity of dentists in the real world.  \n   \n
    Each child will choose their dentist doll, and patient doll. We will then act
    out the different steps involved in a dentist visit. We will have a look at different
    tools that a dentist might use and we will use approachable language in order
    to dispel the idea that visiting the dentist is a scary experience.   \n   \n
    (4) Sugar station:  \n   \n In this station, we lay out a range of plastic toy
    food and drink items on the table. Each child will be tasked with a range of different
    games designed to look at the sugar content of certain items. We will also look
    at how sugar can negatively affect the teeth, as well as other body parts.   \n
    \  \n This interactive station will get the children to measure of sugar content
    on a food weighing scale, and we will compare this to the recommended intake for
    a child of their age.  \n   \n (5) Storytime and colouring:  \n   \n This station
    is a chilled-out time for the kids to colour in our MPDSS-designed colouring sheets
    whilst also listening to a story based on the theme of dentistry and good oral
    health. It will provide the opportunity of volunteers to ask what the children
    have learnt"
