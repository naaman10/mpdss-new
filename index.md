  text_body: "**‘Manchester Paediatric Dentistry Student Society’ (MPDSS) was set
    up in 2020, with the aim of improving the oral health of children in the Manchester
    area. Over the years, the society has evolved to provide a range of events for
    dental students, as well as setting up the first ever podcast dedicated to paediatric
    dentistry!  \n  \nMPDSS have worked hard to provide oral health education sessions
    to key stage 1 pupils. Specifically, we target our sessions towards schools with
    high intakes of children from disadvantaged backgrounds. According to the GMCA,
    “more than 1 in 3 five-year-olds across Greater Manchester experience tooth decay
    – well above the England national average of 25%”. It is the main aim of MPDSS
    to help tackle childhood dental decay and reduce the need for preventable surgeries
    and extractions.**\n\n  \nWe look forward to providing our primary school sessions
    in the 21/22 academic year. Our projects are supported by the University of Manchester
    Student Union and ‘Access All Areas’ project.   \n  \nFor more information about
    us, scroll through the website or contact us via:  \n  \n@MPDSSOC on social media

    card_text: 'One of the core aims of our society is to deliver oral health education
      sessions to primary schools in the Manchester area. "Oral health education"
      entails the exploration of many topics. In our primary school sessions we aim
      to cover: what a healthy diet is, how to take care of your mouth, and what to
      expect when visiting the dentist.'

      image_alt: Speaking presenting
    card_text: Another aim of our society is to invite specialists in the field of
      paediatric dentistry to deliver talks to Manchester dental students. We find
      it imperative that dental students are given the opportunity to gain early exposure
      to paediatric dentistry in order to foster interest in the speciality and to
      help them become well-rounded dentists.

    card_text: Being able to chart mixed dentition easily is a refined skill and dental
      students can often worry about their competency in regards to this task. - This
      is why our society aims to create and deliver a mixed dentition course to dental
      students (of all year groups) at the University of Manchester.
